# Chatbot Career Pathfinder

## Overview
This chatbot helps Western Governors University's Computer Science students explore career paths by asking about their coding experiences and preferences. It automates initial inquiries, allowing career advisors to focus on personalized guidance. Developed using Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) on Pandorabots, this tool serves as an initial touchpoint, providing students with preliminary career suggestions efficiently.
